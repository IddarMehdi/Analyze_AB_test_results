# Analyze_AB_test_results

MyOnlineShop is an e-commerce website, the company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users 
who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

In this project, I utilize inferential statistics and hypothesis testing to determine whether MyOnlineShop should adopt a new web 
page or keep the old one. I also used software tools including Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and logistic regression 
via the statsmodels.api library.
